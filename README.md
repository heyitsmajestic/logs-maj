# Hey It's Majestic Logs

This is not about logs from a server or from a process. No, these logs are Captain's logs as you would see on the "Star Ship Enterprise" in the fictional Star Trek universe. These captains logs are designed to allow the end user to provide information about day to day stuff and then search/index/find that information for later use cases.

## Mission Statement

Many notes platforms are insecure and simply suck. Their UI/features may be amazing and fun and fluffy, but in all fairness, its the contents of the entry that is important to protect. The point of the Captain's Majestic Logs is to provide you with the ability to download and install this application on your local workstation and begin capturing your mission critical updates as they are happening.

## Limitations

This platform is an idea. Nothing more. Whatever happens after the inception of this idea is ultimately going to be up to the global community.

## Goals

I would like to see this application developed and expanded such that interacting with it can take place on multiple kinds of devices like dumbphones and smartphones alike. How that is done? Unsure. But that's the goal. Oh, and also, p2p and e2e encrypted is mandatory with at rest encryption.
